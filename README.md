# Timeisup

## Errors
- Record edit does not show correct task initially

## Bugs
- delete record does not update view
- routes month/y/m/d/edit, month/y/m/d/view, day/y/m/d/r are not stable deeplinks related guards do not work properly

## TODO

- add record manually (proj, task, from, to) (reusable component)
- Backup download, upload
- expand menu for medium and large screens
- Splash

## Maybe

- separate overtime from settings (own overtime page)
- page specific menu actions with own router outlet, keep menu static
