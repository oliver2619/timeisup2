# Timeisup

## Errors
- remove last record does not update view
- remove project throws a lot of errors

## Bugs
- routes month/y/m/d/edit, month/y/m/d/view, day/y/m/d/r are not stable deeplinks related guards do not work properly

## TODO

- add record manually (proj, task, from, to) (reusable component)
- Backup download, upload
- expand menu for medium and large screens
- indexDB
- show 2 digits
- unit tests
- migrate Angular and use signals / selectSignal / inject / input.required

## Maybe

- separate overtime from settings (own overtime page)
- page specific menu actions with own router outlet, keep menu static
- tool to transform between hh:mm and h.mm
