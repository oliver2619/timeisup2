    <h2>Maximum hours per day</h2>
    <p>This setting currently has no impact.</p>
    <h2>Working days</h2>
    <p>Select the weekdays from Sunday to Saturday, that you are supposed to work on.
        This setting affects the calculation of hours per day as well as the overtime.
        Absences during weekdays not configured as working days do not have any impact on the final accounting of the month.
    </p>
    <h2>Hours per day</h2>
    <p>This value is calculated using the settings for 'hours per week', 'pensum' and the number of selected 'working days'.
        Every full absence counts as the equivalent number of hours, that is displayed in this setting.
    </p> 
    <h2>Current overtime</h2>
    <p>This number specifies all hours of overtime, that have been accumulated during all month, regardless wether they are already deleted or not.
        Whenever a month is deleted, the calculated month's overhours can still be saved automatically.
